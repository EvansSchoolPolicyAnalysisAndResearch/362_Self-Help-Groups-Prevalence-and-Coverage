This repository includes Stata .do files developed by the Evans School Policy Analysis & Research Group (EPAR) for the analysis of the coverage and characteristics of self help group use in six Sub-Saharan African countries, using data from Intermedia's Financial Inclusion Insights (FII) and Financial Sector Deepening Trust's FinScope surveys. These files were developed as part of the EPAR "Self Help Groups Prevalence and Coverage" project: https://evans.uw.edu/policy-impact/epar/research/self-help-groups-prevalence-and-coverage
